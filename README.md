Steam sometimes serves outdated mod versions, and Oxygen Not Included is also available on the Epic Games Store.
Local copies of these mods are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/peterhaneve/ONIMods/releases/tag/ModsLatest) section.
These mods should be installed into the `local` folder, creating it if it does not already exist.
Mods should remain in their own subfolder.
